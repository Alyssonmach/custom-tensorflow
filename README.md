Custom Models, Layers, and Loss Functions with TensorFlow. Program Files for TensorFlow Integrated Courses: Advanced Techniques.

### Week 1 - Functional APIs
***

Compare how the Functional API differs from the Sequential API, and see how the Functional API gives you additional flexibility in designing models. Practice using the functional API and build a Siamese network!

### Week 2 - Custom Loss Functions
***

Loss functions help measure how well a model is doing, and are used to help a neural network learn from the training data. Learn how to build custom loss functions, including the contrastive loss function that is used in a Siamese network.

### Week 3 - Custom Layers
***

Custom layers give you the flexibility to implement models that use non-standard layers. Practice building off of existing standard layers to create custom layers for your models.

### Week 4 - Custom Models
***

You can build off of existing models to add custom functionality. This week, extend the TensorFlow Model Class to build a ResNet model!

### Week 5 - Callbacks
***

Custom callbacks allow you to customize what your model outputs or how it behaves during training. This week, implement a custom callback to stop training once the callback detects overfitting.
